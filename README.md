Open web pages

## About
A simple Skill to open web pages in your default browser or on any Mycroft-GUI enabled device. 

Currently Sites must be included in the `sites.value` file, or added to the Skill settings as a custom url. 

Contributions to this list are welcomed, as are suggestions for better ways to translate natural language into the correct url.

## Examples
* "Go to Duck Duck Go"
* "Open Todoist"
* "Launch Gmail
* "Navigate to Reddit"

On a Mark II or other Mycroft-GUI enabled device the requested site will remain active until closed.
* "Close this site"
* "Exit browser"
